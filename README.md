VERY WORK IN PROGRESS CIRCUITPYTHON PACKAGES/SCRIPTS FOR ARCADE CODER

None of this would have been possible without [padraigfl's efforts!](https://github.com/padraigfl/twsu-arcade-coder-esp32)  More information on the progress of reverse engineering the boards can be found there as well!

### Misc

Code definitely needs optimisation and other work.  Currently this REPO is mainly used to share my progress.
